        <p>"Greg looked after us perfectly! We had a wonderful time in Cape Town, and Greg contributed enormously to our experience. He was thoughtful, informative and pleasant to spend time with, and he anticipated our every need. We learned so much about Cape Town and the history, flora and fauna of South Africa. It was a truly memorable experience."</p>

        <p>"We arrived back in the UK full of wonderful memories from our trip with you in Uganda. We all loved our time with you and were delighted by the engagement and commitment you showed both to us having an unforgettable experience and also pointing out the desperate need for conservation efforts and the role we can play in facilitating this."</p>

        <p>"We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Uganda with Greg and Simon. We had the pleasure of being with people, who were not only very knowledgeable about wildlife, but were also passionate about conservation. Their energy and commitment to making our holiday as fabulous as it was, is something we as a family of 6 are truly grateful for. We had amazing sightings, our daughter Laura a very close encounter with a curious Gorilla and saw so much of Ugandan life. We have every intention of booking our next trip with Bellingham Safaris. Thank you so much!"</p>

        <p>"Thank you very much for all your help and time in organising this amazing trip. It was a fantastic experience! We have so many wonderful memories with Keiko, Remo, James and all the guides and staff who looked after us so well. Sharing these two fun weeks of laughs, safaris, dinners (and wines) and chats with such warm-hearted, friendly, welcoming and lovely people made it unbeatable! So thank you so much specially to Keiko, Remo and James from both of us for this. James was great, teaching us so much about the birds, animals and South Africa. He looked after every detail so we totally relaxed and didn’t have to think a thing, well other than selecting what delicious food to eat! South Africa is such a beautiful country surrounded by nature and wonderful animals…that I hope we get a chance one day to return to explore more of it! Thank you very much once again to you all!"</p>

        <p>"It is with great pleasure that I send you our warmest thanks for the planning our last Namibia Safari. How could you top our last 4 journeys? Everything was planned with so much knowledge and kindness to give us the maximum for our trip. And it was indeed the best we could get. We had so much pleasure and enjoyed every day. All in one: Thank you. It was a wonderful trip. Who has not seen all that has not seen Namibia. We had been before but this was to top everything we saw previously. Now we are happily back home with new experiences and beautiful pictures in our camera and video but above all in our soul."</p>

        <p>"Organisation was excellent from start to finish – it was seamless and not easy to achieve in a country where if it goes wrong then it could have big repercussions for a trip like this. All staff involved in transport and at the lodges were great – five star. In Indrajit we had a superb trip leader whose knowledge and in particular his skill at putting you in the right place to observe was excellent in terms of the wildlife. His presence on the trip was always just right (not overbearing and not under caring for want of a better phrase) and his organisational skills where superb. He is obviously well respected by his Naturalist peers in India and this helps make these trips work even better. Accommodation was overall excellent – staff in the main superb and attentive and service excellent often going beyond expectation. So in conclusion a great trip brilliantly organised – thanks so much for making it a brilliant holiday that we will remember always."</p>
