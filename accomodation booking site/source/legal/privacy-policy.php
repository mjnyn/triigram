      BigFeet B.V. (the company behind BigFeet™) is registered and based in
      Amsterdam, the Netherlands ("Booking.com", "we", "us" or "our"),
      from where it renders an online accommodation reservation service (the
      "Service") on its website (the "Website"), and is supported internationally
      by its local group companies (the "support companies"). The support

      do not render the Service and do not own, operate or manage the Website or any

      First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s the kind
      ofthing all these sorts of notices say, but frankly we mean it. You’ve placed
      your trust in us by using the Booking.com services and we value that trust.
      That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data
      you give us. We act in our customers’ interest and we are transparent about
      the processing of your personal data.
    </p>

      This document describes how we use and process your personal data, hopefully provided
      in a readable and transparent manner so you can get where we’re coming from without
      getting bored senseless. As an added bonus, it also tells you how to contact us if
      you have questions about your personal data, which we’re more than happy to answer.
      Please also read our separate Cookie Statement, which tells you how Booking.com makes
      use of cookies and other similar technologies. For a better understanding of what we
      mean by “Trip”, “Trip Provider”, “Trip Service” and “Trip Reservation”, please read the
      Booking.com Terms and Conditions.

      If you’ve ever used us before, you’ll know that Booking.com offers online travel-related
      services through our own websites and mobile apps, as well as through other online platforms
      such as partners’ websites and social media. Why point that out, you ask? Well, here’s the
      thing. All the information that follows applies to not one, not two, but all of these
      platforms. Several platforms, one privacy statement.
    </p>

  <div class="legal-container">
    <p>
      This one privacy statement applies to any kind of information we collect through these platforms
      or other means connected to these platforms (such as contacting our customer service team via email).
      It makes for a lot less tedious reading. If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also
      check out our Privacy Statement for Business Partners to understand how personal data is further
      processed as part of the business relationship.

  <div class="legal-container">
    <p>
      We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time. If you care about your privacy, visit this page
      regularly and you’ll know exactly where you stand. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement which
      will have an impact on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes
      than communicated in the past in this Privacy Statement), we will notify you of these changes before
      the new activities begin.
