                    Once you've created a saved list to keep track of listings
                    you like, you can share it with others, add and remove
                    listings, or delete the list altogether.

                    If you want to narrow down your choices when looking for
                    a place to stay, you can use search filters to narrow down
                    your search results.

                    When you search for a place to stay on Bigfeet, you can narrow
                    your options by using filters and reading the descriptions of
                    places to check if they’d be a good fit for your trip.

                    As long as you enter your destination, travel dates, and number
                    of guests when searching on Bigfeet, all listings that show should
                    be available for your trip.

                <p>
                    If you cancel a reservation, your refund amount is determined by your
                    host’s cancellation policy and how close to your trip you are at the
                    time of your cancellation.

                    Yes, children can travel on Bigfeet, but some hosts have specified that
                    their space may not be safe or suitable for children or infants.

                    Before you add dates, the nightly price you see for a listing
                    is the host’s default or minimum price. Some hosts have custom
                    prices that override the default or minimum for specific dates
                    or time periods (including holidays, weekends, and week-long
                    or month-long reservations).

                <p>
                    As with many places around the world Africa has its places of danger
                    and these should be avoided. There are many horror stories coming out
                    of the continent but in general Africa is a safe destination to travel
                    to - if you take the necessary precautions.

                    Planning your trip with Siyabona will prevent any misunderstandings and
                    allow you to enjoy what will certainly be your most memorable holidays.

            <h3>How can I prevent contracting Malaria in Africa?</h3>
            <fieldset>
                <p>
                    Although malaria is prevalent in Africa the chance of you as a visitor
                    contracting the disease is very small. Malaria is rife in highly populated
                    areas and these areas are generally not on the tourist route. Nonetheless,
                    malaria is a killer.
                    It is essential to take prophylactics which must be administered by your GP's
                    before departing on your safari. Read this Malaria Precaution Covering up in
                    the evenings and using repellent on the areas that cannot be covered will assist
                    in preventing mosquitoes biting.

            <fieldset>
                <p>
                    As Africa straddles the equator and the two tropics there will be a destination to
                    visit at any time of the year. In the past it was thought that countries should be
                    avoided during the rainy season but this has proved to be misleading in many cases
                    as the rainy seasons provide some of the most dramatic experiences. A travel
                    consultant will advise on the options at specific times of the year.

            <fieldset>
                <p>
                    Medical kits are available at lodges and in safari vehicles to treat minor inflictions.
                    You, however, should pack your own basic medical kit with painkillers, antiseptic cream,
                    anti histamine and plasters. Prescription medicines must be brought with on safari and
                    it is important to note that a description of the medicine should be obtained from your
                    practitioner in case of emergency while on safari.

                <p>
                    The standard of food is generally very high - even in the remotest lodges.
                    Most lodges will have qualified chefs on hand. Part of the safari experience
                    today is the cuisine and a great emphasis is placed on food - and there will
                    be more than sufficient.
