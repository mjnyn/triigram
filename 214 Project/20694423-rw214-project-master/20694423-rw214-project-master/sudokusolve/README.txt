The 'frameload.java' 

Run the program with both the board and command files as arguments(WITHOUT their extensions). 

From there on choose whether you want to run using the command line or GUI (BUT ENSURE that you run the program with BOTH files initially). 

The input files should be under the /src folder of the project. 

Input ONLY the file names.ONLY.

The program sometimes displays the warning "Note: ./Graph.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details." in this case please ingnore the warning and proceed forward.

After running the main class, the initial board is displayed (in both in GUI and terminal mode) on the main text area.

The output for the different rules can be found under \src folder.

O GUI mode, selected the desired cell by choosing the subgrid letter (A-I), the row number (0-2) and column number (0-2) from their desired combo boxes.

The 'Values' button can be selected to  see the possible values of the desired cell (use this button after the desired cell has been seleceted).

After the desired call has been selected, choose the desired rule to run from the 'Rules' combo box. 

After choosing the cell and rule, the 'Apply rule' button can be selected inorder to run the rule on the specified rule. NOTE some rules may require an extra step of insterting a number (this will be insterted using JOptionPane which will pop up after pressing the button). 

The effect of the rule will be displayed on the 'Rule effect' text area and the updated board on the main text area.
